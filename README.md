GameBritannia's Twitch Chat Bot

This is an Twitch IRC channel bot intended to react to user '!' commands as well as automatically execute certain actions based on user activity.

It was built with the intention to be used on GameBritannia team channels and open-sourced as many alternatives avaliable are locked behind a paywall.

Information on specific command usages and bot progress can be found on the project's GitHub wiki.
